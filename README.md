# BiquadrisPreview

By: Eddie Zhang, Owen Wong, and Tom Han

Biquadris is a two-player, turn-based Tetris clone created for the final project of CS 246: Object Oriented Programming at the University of Waterloo. Biquadris was made with C++, and adheres to several software design principles such as MVC, the Publish-Subscribe pattern, and RAII. It received a final mark of 110%, which is the maximum possible mark the project could have received. Our source code is available upon request, but it is not open to the public due to Policy 71 at the University of Waterloo.

To learn more about how we made the game and all the extra gameplay features we implemented, see design.pdf. 

Here is a preview GIF of the game:
